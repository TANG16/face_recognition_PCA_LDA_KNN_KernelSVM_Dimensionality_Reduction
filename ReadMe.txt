1. Extract the code package.
2. Open Matlab.
3. There must be three folders in the zip file. The first folder ‘code’ contains all the executable Matlab files. The other two folders are the two formats of data sets, ‘data’ and ‘Dataset’ where the data is present in the respective folders and in the same folder respectively.
4. Before executing the files, paste the URI of the folder ‘Dataset’ in the file ‘Vivek_LDA.m’ and paste the URI of the folder ‘data’ in all other files.
5. Execute the project by beginning with the file name ‘Task1_Vivek_PCA_KNN.m’ and then continuing with the files in order of their Task order. There must be six files namely ‘Task1_Vivek_PCA_KNN.m’, ‘Task2_Vivek_KNN_resize.m’, ‘Task3_Vivek_LDA_KNN.m’,‘Task4_Vivek_PCA_LDA_KNN.m’,‘Task5_Vivek_KERNEL_SVM’and‘Task6_Vivek_PCA_KERNEL_SVM.m'.
6. The other files are the functions which will be invoked by other functions. Those need not be executed separately.
7. The tasks involving PCA and LDA will take a long time to get executed. So other tasks can be executed first if needed.
8. Execute each file by clicking Run button on the toolbar in the Matlab window.
